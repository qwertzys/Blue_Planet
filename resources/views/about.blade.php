            <p"> Blue Planet is a website that aims to raise public awareness about the problem of ocean pollution and also the impact of excessive plastic use. 
                This website is an intermediary to convey the latest information and facts about ocean cleanliness and plastic waste, 
                as well as an invitation to get involved in efforts to reduce plastic waste and also maintain ocean cleanliness. 
                We as developers hope that this website can be an appropriate educational intermediary 
                and also inspire more people to get involved in efforts to preserve our marine ecosystem.</p>
